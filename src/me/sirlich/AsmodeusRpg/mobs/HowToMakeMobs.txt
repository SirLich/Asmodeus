1) Add the new mob type to RpgEntityType ENUM. Naming convention is RPG_<name> such as RPG_CRITTER

2) Create the mob class in mobs/monsters. Make sure to extend whichever Entity you want (i.e. Entity Zombie)
and add the correct PFG pathfinders. Make your own PathFinders if you need.

3) Make sure to register your mob in the main class, otherwise it will be invisible.

4) Create a .txt version of the mob. Each mob will need different things. For example spawning mobs will need stuff like
 - Mobs spawned
 - mobs spawned lvl
 - Mob type spawned
 Mobs without the spawn pathfinder won't need stuff like this. Think hard about what you want GH's to edit, cause its sort of hard to change later.

5) Add a make<name> method in MobCreator (might be refactored by the time you see this).

6) Add a line to RpgSummon so you can test various mob levels.
